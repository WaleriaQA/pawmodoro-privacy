# Privacy Policy for Pawmodoro

**Pawmodoro respects your privacy.**

This extension does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data.

All data used by Pawmodoro (such as timer settings, tasks, and optional custom alarm sounds) is stored locally on your device using Chrome’s storage APIs and never leaves your browser.

## Pawmodoro does not:

- collect personal information
- track browsing activity
- use analytics or third-party services
- share data with external servers

If you choose to upload a custom alarm sound, the file is stored locally and used only for playing notifications.

Future versions may introduce optional features. If data practices change, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
